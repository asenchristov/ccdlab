# Software (sketch) for Arduino_A

* the Arduino_A is an arbitrary name, I just need to identify what this particular arduino is supposed to be doing.
* the implementation is using the [MIN protocol](https://github.com/min-protocol/min)
* the part for the GY-21 sensor is modified version of: [GY-21](https://github.com/JonasGMorsch/GY-21)
* the [SoftwareWire](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire) library is used for being able to use any two digital pins as I2C comunication port
